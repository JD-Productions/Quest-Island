# Quest Island Demo

Hello! This is the Quest Island Demo version! Thank you for testing this demo! I appreciate it very much.

There *will* be bugs, so please let me know about them in the issues section.

Game Rules:
* You just got here, and only have five dollars. You can beg for money, then get a job. Once you have a job, you can work for money. 
* The trading post is where you can buy food, weapons, items, and more. There is currently no use for any of these, but there will be in coming updates.
* There is no main goal of the game.
* Send feedback and ideas to [knapptime_wv@outlook.com][email]

Thank you for playing Quest Island Demo.
